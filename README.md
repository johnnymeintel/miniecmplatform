# ECM Platform Engineering Demonstration

A simplified Enterprise Content Management platform built to demonstrate platform engineering concepts and rapid technology acquisition.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates core ECM functionality using modern platform engineering practices. Built as a learning exercise to understand enterprise content management systems and demonstrate practical implementation skills.

**Built by:** Johnny Meintel  
**Purpose:** Technical skill demonstration and platform engineering learning  
**Timeline:** Weekend sprint implementation  

## 🏗 Architecture

```
ECM Platform
├── Document Engine (Flask API)
├── File Storage System  
├── Metadata Management
├── Docker Containerization
└── Health Monitoring
```

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **Storage:** Local file system + JSON metadata
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints
- **Health Monitoring:** Built-in health checks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd ecm-platform-demo

# Build and run
docker build -t mini-ecm-api .
docker run -d --name ecm-api -p 8080:8080 mini-ecm-api

# Test health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask werkzeug

# Run application
python mini_ecm_api.py

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/api/documents` | Upload document |
| GET | `/api/documents` | List documents |
| GET | `/api/documents?q=search` | Search documents |
| GET | `/api/documents/<id>/download` | Download document |

## 📋 Features Implemented

- ✅ Document upload with metadata
- ✅ File storage management
- ✅ Document search functionality
- ✅ RESTful API design
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ File type validation

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
# Upload document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/documents \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "title=Sample Document" \
  -F "author=User" \
  -F "tags=demo,test"

# List documents
curl http://localhost:8080/api/documents

# Search documents
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/documents?q=sample"
```

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- **Platform Engineering Principles:** Infrastructure as Code, containerization, health monitoring
- **API Development:** RESTful design, error handling, file operations
- **Enterprise Patterns:** Document management, metadata handling, systematic architecture
- **DevOps Practices:** Docker deployment, health checks, professional documentation

## 🔧 Platform Engineering Concepts

- **Containerization:** Application packaged with all dependencies
- **Health Monitoring:** Automated health checks and status reporting
- **API-First Design:** Clean separation between storage and interface
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling and proper HTTP responses
- **Documentation:** Professional documentation and usage examples

## ⚠ Project Scope & Limitations

**This is a demonstration/learning project:**
- Simplified storage (local files vs enterprise databases)
- Basic security (production would require authentication/authorization)
- Limited scalability (single instance vs distributed architecture)
- Learning-focused implementation (not production-ready)

**Enterprise considerations not implemented:**
- Database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- User authentication and authorization
- Advanced search capabilities
- Workflow automation
- Compliance and audit trails
- Performance optimization
- High availability/clustering

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Database integration (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Web interface for document management
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Docker Compose multi-service architecture
- [ ] Advanced search with indexing
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Workflow automation
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard

## 🤝 Background & Context

Built as part of a technical skill development initiative to:
- Understand enterprise content management systems
- Practice platform engineering principles
- Demonstrate rapid technology acquisition
- Apply cloud computing and automation knowledge

## 📝 Technical Notes

**File Structure:**
```
├── mini_ecm_api.py          # Main Flask application
├── Dockerfile               # Container configuration
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── ecm_storage/            # Document storage directory
├── ecm_metadata/           # Metadata storage directory
└── README.md               # This file
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Flask over FastAPI:** Simplicity and learning curve
- **JSON metadata:** Quick implementation over database complexity
- **Docker deployment:** Industry standard containerization
- **RESTful design:** Enterprise API standards

## 🔍 Testing the Platform

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Create test document
echo "Sample content" > test.txt

# Upload document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/documents \
  -F "file=@test.txt" \
  -F "title=Test Document" \
  -F "author=Demo User"

# List all documents
curl http://localhost:8080/api/documents

# Search documents
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/documents?q=test"
```

## 📚 Learning Resources Used

- Flask Documentation
- Docker Best Practices
- RESTful API Design Principles
- Enterprise Content Management Concepts
- Platform Engineering Patterns

## ⚡ Quick Demo

```bash
